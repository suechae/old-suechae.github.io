abstract = "Coronary arteriovenous fistula (CAVF) is a rare condition, which is defined as an anomalous termination of the coronary arteries. The etiology of CAVF is either congenital or acquired, and iatrogenic CAVF is most commonly caused by cardiovascular surgery or percutaneous intervention. Most of the prenatally diagnosed CAVFs were related to complex heart disease, and only few cases of isolated CAVF have been reported so far. Herein, we successfully diagnosed isolated CAVF by fetal echocardiography at 25.3 weeks of gestations. The accurate prenatal diagnosis resulted in the prompt decision of postnatal surgical correction, and the neonate thrived well without any complications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of isolated CAVF to be diagnosed prenatally, following successful postnatal surgical correction in Korea."
